## Bio
My name is Dongsheng Yang (杨东升). I am a first year Ph.D. student at Princeton University advised by Prof. [Kai Li](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~li/) and Prof. [Wyatt Lloyd](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wlloyd/index.html). I recieved M.Sc. in Computer Science degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019, where I assisted in building the automatic DBMS tuning system [OtterTune](https://github.com/cmu-db/ottertune) advised by Prof. [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/). Before that, I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science degree (with SUMMA CUM LAUDE) from Peking University in 2018, where I worked with Prof. Tong Yang and led two projects on succinct data structures for data stream processing.

## Reseach Interests
I am broadly interested in innovating algorithms for data-intensive applications and systems. I am currently working on machine learning based caching algorithms for in memory caching.
