## Bio
My name is Dongsheng Yang (杨东升). I will start my PhD study at Princeton University in 2020 fall. I got my B.Sc. in Computer Science degree (with SUMMA CUM LAUDE) from Peking University in 2018, where I worked with Prof. [Tong Yang](http://net.pku.edu.cn/~yangtong/) and led two projects on innovating randomized data structures. After that, I recieved M.Sc. in Computer Science degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 2019, where I assisted in building the automatic DBMS tuning system [OtterTune](https://github.com/cmu-db/ottertune), advised by Prof. [Andy Pavlo](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/).

## Reseach Interests
I have been working on *beatiful algorithms* (including but not limited to randomized algotihms, graph algorithms, and machine learning algorithms) for *data-intensive applications* (including but not limited to database systems, network systems, distributed systems and data mining). I will narrow down to a specific topic during my PhD study.
